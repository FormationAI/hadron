* TODOs

  - Reuse the Tap concept for Join data definitions, maybe get rid of
    the (String -> DataSet) concept?

  - Make a better CLI interface that can specify common hadoop
    settings (e.g. EMR vs. Cloudera)

  - Add built-in, common reducers, mappers, etc.

  - (?) Add support for parsing file locations, other settings from
    a config file

  - Any chance for a non-hadoop, single-machine backend via 'sort'?
