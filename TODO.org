* TODOs

  - Integrated check for whether target Tap exists - if so, skip the
    query and move onto next. If not, run the query.

    - Check to make sure file actually exists and size > 0. If not,
      run the query, returning error from hadoop to aler the user.

  - Reuse the Tap concept for Join data definitions, maybe get rid of
    the (String -> DataSet) concept?

    - hash tap paths to limit length impact
    - prefix with given order so the sets remain ordered

  - Make a better CLI interface that can specify common hadoop
    settings (e.g. EMR vs. Cloudera)

  - Add built-in, common reducers, mappers, etc.

  - (?) Add support for parsing file locations, other settings from
    a config file

  - Any chance for a non-hadoop, single-machine backend via 'sort'?
